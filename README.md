# TRACE: Tracking and Recognition of Activity Certificates and Events

## Overview
**TRACE** is a web-based platform designed to facilitate the storage and management of activity certificates and points for students. The system aims to provide an intuitive interface for students, tutors, and administrators to manage their activity records efficiently.

## Objectives
- Develop a user-friendly web application for managing activity certificates and points.
- Enable students to upload and manage their activity points based on participation in events.
- Allow tutors to verify and view student activity points.
- Include an admin panel for managing records and generating reports.
- Integrate a Telegram support group for assistance with the platform.

## Key Features
- **User Interface**: Intuitive design for easy navigation and management of certificates.
- **Activity Points Management**: Students can track their progress towards the required 100 activity points for graduation.
- **Admin Functions**: Admins can manage student records, generate reports, and update the database.
- **Support Integration**: A Telegram bot provides real-time assistance for users facing issues.

## Motivation
The motivation behind TRACE stems from the lack of an effective system to track and manage activity points and certificates, which has led to inefficiencies in current processes.

## Methodology
### Technologies Used
- **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for building a responsive user interface.
- **Back-End**: PHP and SQL for database management and server-side logic.
